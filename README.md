# 👋 Hi, I'm Hemanth Kumar Narra!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Commerce student** who's deeply curious about the world of technology.  
Even though I come from a non-technical background, I’ve developed a strong interest in how things work — especially **open-source software** and **self-hosting tools** with great documentation.

### 🛠️ What I Know So Far

- Basic knowledge of **Python** 🐍
- How to explore and use **ChatGPT** to learn and solve problems
- How to set up and **self-host applications** like note-taking tools, file servers, and more

---

## 🔭 What I'm Learning

Right now, I’m exploring:
- 🧩 Python scripting for automation and small projects
- 🧠 Using AI tools (like ChatGPT) to support my learning
- 🌐 Hosting software on my own (self-hosting tools like Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, etc.)
- 📝 Writing clean, useful documentation for whatever I set up or build

---

## 💡 Why I'm on GitHub

I use GitHub to:
- Save and track my learning journey
- Share my self-hosting experiments
- Practice working with code and markdown
- Document projects in a way that’s easy to follow — for both myself and others

You’ll mostly find:
- 📁 Config files and scripts for self-hosted setups
- 🛠️ Basic Python scripts
- 📝 Well-documented notes and guides

---

## 🌱 Goals for the Future

- Get better at Python and possibly try web development (maybe Flask or Django)
- Create detailed step-by-step guides for self-hosted setups
- Build or contribute to beginner-friendly, well-documented open-source projects

---

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I’m always happy to chat with other beginners, tech hobbyists, or anyone who enjoys tinkering with self-hosted software.
