If you’ve been practising as a Chartered Accountant for some time, you probably didn’t notice a loud announcement saying “ICAI advertising rules have changed”. There was no dramatic circular or single notification that suddenly made websites, blogs, or LinkedIn posts feel safe.

And yet, over the last few years, something fundamental has changed.

What earlier felt risky, explaining your services publicly, writing blog posts, sharing professional updates online, or even maintaining a detailed website is now permitted under the updated ethical framework of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

The reform was quiet, but its impact on how Chartered Accountants communicate is significant.

This post explains what ICAI allows now (as of 2026), what still isn’t allowed, and how CAs can present their work clearly, factually, and ethically, without second guessing every sentence they publish.

## Advertising by Chartered Accountants: What Is Allowed Now

Yes, advertising is allowed under ICAI rules, subject to conditions.

CAs and CA firms may advertise professional services, both online and offline. This includes promoting specific areas of practice and using platforms like Google or LinkedIn to reach prospective clients.

The key requirement is how the advertisement is framed. It must be factual, objective, non-comparative, and free from guarantees.

For example, statements like “GST Compliance Services for Private Companies” or “Statutory Audit Services under the Companies Act, 2013” are acceptable. Claims such as “Best CA firm in Hyderabad” or “Guaranteed tax savings” are not.

The line is simple: describe what you do, not why you are better than others.

## CA Websites: From Name Boards to Professional Clarity

Earlier, many CA firms hesitated to publish detailed website content. A website often existed only as a digital name board with basic contact details.

That hesitation is no longer required.

A compliant CA website today can include detailed service pages, areas or industries served, partner and team profiles, office details, photographs, contact forms, and published articles or updates.

A page explaining how you handle GST compliance or what an audit engagement typically involves is now considered professional communication, not solicitation, as long as the language remains factual and restrained.

## Blogs, Articles, and Knowledge Sharing Are Encouraged

One of the most important shifts in ICAI’s approach is the recognition that knowledge sharing is part of the profession.

Chartered Accountants can now write blog posts, publish regulatory updates, share compliance checklists, send newsletters, and explain changes in law. Content written to educate clients or the public is clearly permitted.

Topics such as common GST mistakes businesses make, how to prepare for a tax audit, or income-tax changes explained simply are acceptable when the intent is education rather than promotion.

## Social Media Use by CAs

ICAI now permits professional use of social media platforms, especially LinkedIn.

CAs can share regulatory insights, post short explainers, publish compliance reminders, announce hiring, or share firm updates. The focus remains on professionalism and restraint.

The platform itself is not the issue. Tone and intent are.

Educational and factual posts are acceptable. Aggressive calls to action or exaggerated claims are not.

## Fee Disclosure and Engagement Transparency

While ICAI continues to discourage price-based competition, fee transparency is allowed.

Firms may explain how fees are determined, clarify scope based pricing, or indicate fee ranges. This helps set expectations and reduces misunderstandings during engagements.

For example, stating that audit fees depend on turnover, complexity, and scope, with a detailed quote provided after initial review, is perfectly acceptable.

## Declaring Areas of Practice and Experience

CAs can now openly state their areas of practice and the kind of clients they serve. This could include startup compliance, GST advisory for manufacturers, or audit services for educational institutions.

What remains prohibited is turning such descriptions into claims of dominance or superiority. Describing your work is permitted; comparing yourself to others is not.

## Global Networks and Professional Associations

ICAI also allows transparent disclosure of overseas associations, referral networks, and international professional collaborations.

This is particularly relevant for firms handling NRI clients or cross border transactions. Such disclosures must be accurate, non-misleading, and should not compromise independence.

## What ICAI Still Does Not Allow

Despite the relaxations, certain restrictions remain firmly in place.

Claims of being “No.1” or “best”, comparative advertising, guarantees of outcomes, misleading credentials, and undignified or aggressive promotion are still prohibited.

ICAI has relaxed communication rules, not ethical standards.

## What This Change Really Means for Chartered Accountants

For small and mid-size CA firms, this creates real opportunities to communicate better, attract the right clients, and set expectations upfront without compromising ethics.


This is something I’m trying to do, write clearly about the work we do and present it properly online. Not as marketing, but as documentation of how a CA office actually works. A simple blog and a clean website aren’t risks anymore. They’re just practical tools, and ICAI finally recognises that.
